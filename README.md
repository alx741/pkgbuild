Contributions to the Arch User Repository
==========================
* If you only want to install particular package I maintain, you can download the PKGBUILD you need here or in the [AUR](https://aur4.archlinux.org/packages/?O=0&SeB=m&K=gtbjj&outdated=&SB=n&SO=a&PP=50&do_Search=Go).
* I'm very new to package maintenance so if you find errors, typos, or have other helpful suggestions to make please feel encouraged to fork and make a pull request.
* Previous themes and compilations I've made for [syslinux](), [grub2](), and [lxdm]() can also be found here, but **I will not be packaging or maintining them**.  Feel free to download and / or fork and do with them what you please (see their respective license information).
