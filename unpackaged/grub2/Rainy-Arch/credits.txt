	This theme was modified by grandtheftjiujitsu on the Arch Linux Forums.  The theme is a highly modified version of the "Antergos-Bluez" theme by Dustin Falgout (dustinfalgout@gmail.com).  Antergos-Bluez was used a safety / base code and then modified.  Antergos-Bluez is based on the ArchLinux theme by American Jesus (Arch Linux Forums).  This theme thankfully and greatfully uses the install script included in American Jesus's theme (also in Antergos-Bluez).  Selection icons and menu borders were taken from the "Beefy" theme by LegendaryBibo.
