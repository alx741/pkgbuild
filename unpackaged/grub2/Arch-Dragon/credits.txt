     This is a modified version of "Antergos-Bluez" by Dustin Falgout (dustinfalgout@gmail.com).  Antergos-Bluez is based on the "Archlinux" theme by American_Jesus.  Credit for the instllation script also belongs (in part) to both the aformentioned parties.  To the best of my knowledge American_Jesus created the script but I beleive changes were also made by Falgout.  My contributions to that file extend only to appropriately renaming the theme.  Selection Icons and Menu borders / images were modified from the "Beefy" theme by LegendaryBibo.
